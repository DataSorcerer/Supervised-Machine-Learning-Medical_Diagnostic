# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Medical_Diagnostic   
   
   Since past few years, supervised machine learning techniques have been leveraged successfully for building highly accurate predictive models for medical diagnostic tests. In this experiment, I have explored the problem of predicting medical test outcome based on following features:
- Plasma glucose level
- Blood Pressure
- Skin thickness
- Number of pregnancies
- Insulin
- BMI
- Age
	
   Outcome of the test: This is a binary classification problem, so we classify if test results RE positive/ negative. There are only a limited amount of training samples available (376). These are divided into train/ test and validation sets. The performance is evaluated over this held out (validation set), so that performance can be gauged over truly unseen data.

Performance metrics used: 10 - fold stratified cross validation is performed and following performance metrics are computed:
1. Confusion Matrix
2. Accuracy
3. Sensitivity
4. Specificity
5. ROC curves are examined
